I am generally available via email, at `me@` this domain. I may also be found on the <a href="https://quickstrom.zulipchat.com">Quickstrom Zulip</a>, the SPLS Zulip, the TYPES Zulip, the Agda Zulip, the <a href="https://cogent-club.slack.com/">cogent-club slack</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/kamatsu8">twitter</a> and <a href="https://types.pl/@liamoc">the types.pl mastodon instance</a>. My office is Room N213 in the Computer Science Building 108 on the ANU Campus. The office door is open to the public so feel free to pop over if you want to visit me. To ensure my availability, it may be wise to first contact me via other means to make an appointment. 

If you are a student or a colleague, please contact me via my ANU email (`liam.oconnor` at `anu.edu.au`), or on the appropriate course forum (e.g. Piazza).

If you are in posession of my telephone number, please avoid calling unless absolutely necessary.
