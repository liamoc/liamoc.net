I am generally available via email, at `me@` this domain. I may also be found on the <a href="https://quickstrom.zulipchat.com">Quickstrom Zulip</a>, the SPLS Zulip, the TYPES Zulip, the Agda Zulip, the <a href="https://cogent-club.slack.com/">cogent-club slack</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/kamatsu8">twitter</a> and <a href="https://types.pl/@liamoc">the types.pl mastodon instance</a>. My office is Room 3.47A in the Informatics Forum at the main Edinburgh campus. If you would like to see me in person, please contact me via other means first to make an appointment. 

If you are a student or a colleague, please contact me via my Edinburgh email (`l.oconnor` at `ed.ac.uk`) or my ANU email (`liam.oconnor` at `anu.edu.au`), or on the appropriate course forum (e.g. Piazza).

If you are in posession of my telephone number, please avoid calling unless absolutely necessary.
