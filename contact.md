I am generally available via email, at `me@` this domain. I may also be found on the <a href="https://cogent-club.slack.com/">cogent-club slack</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/kamatsu8">twitter</a>. I presumably will have an office in the Informatics Forum, I will update this page when it exists. If you would like
to see me in person, please contact me via other means first to make an appointment. 

If you are a student or a colleague, please contact me via my Edinburgh email (`l.oconnor`), or on the appropriate course forum (e.g. Piazza).

If you are in posession of my telephone number, please avoid calling unless absolutely necessary.
