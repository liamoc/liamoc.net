I am generally available via email, at `me@` this domain. I may also be found on the <a href="https://cogent-club.slack.com/">cogent-club slack</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/kamatsu8">twitter</a>. I have an office at UNSW Kensington K17 Lv5, 501I (that is a letter I not an L). If you would like
to see me in person, please contact me via other means first to make an appointment.

If you are a student or a colleague, please contact me via my CSE email (username is `liamoc`), or on the appropriate course forum (e.g. Piazza).

If you are in posession of my telephone number, please avoid calling unless absolutely necessary.
