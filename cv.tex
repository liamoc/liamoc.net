\section{SUMMARY}
I'm a computer scientist specialising in programming languages. I have skills in formal verification and theorem proving (e.g Agda and Isabelle/HOL) as well as functional programming, particularly Haskell. I also enjoy programming in languages such as Scala and ML. I have research experience with formal semantics of programming languages, particularly in the encoding of logic into language type systems, and the use of this as a proof method via the Curry Howard correspondence. In the past I have developed a great deal of experience in web development, including experience at Google in the development of a new product (Google Wave). I follow closely development of new standards for the Web. I also have some skill at concurrent and distributed programmming, and I'm aware of various approaches to concurrency abstraction and concurrent data structures. I am able to structure constructive proofs of properties on concurrent programs using standard methods.

\section{EDUCATION} 
                {\sl PhD (currently studying)} Computer Science\\
                University of New South Wales. In 2014 I was also affiliated
                with NICTA.
                \\ 
                \emph{Thesis topic:} ``Language-aided Systems Verification'' \\
                Focusing on the use of linear types and other PL research to
                make verifying low-level software systems for functional
                correctness cheaper and easier.

                {\sl Bachelor of Science (Hons. 1st Cl.),} Computer Science\\
                University of New South Wales. Completed several courses with high distinction
                and earned four awards:
                \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
                    \item Macquarie Undergraduate Performance Award (1st Year)

                \emph{Honours thesis:} ``Formalising GHC's Type System'', a dependently typed formalisation
                of the type system of a Haskell compiler.\\
                \emph{Special Project:} ``PhracJS - A Lazy, Purely Functional Language for Browsers'', an investigation into the suitability of purely functional programming for the web browser via compilation to JavaScript.
Involved the implementation of a small compiler.          \\
                \emph{Special Project:} ``Gentzen - A Beginner's Theorem Prover'', a carefully designed theorem prover intended to aid in the teaching of introductory courses for formal semantics of programming languages.
