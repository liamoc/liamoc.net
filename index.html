<h2>Welcome</h2>

<img src="/images/me.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 15px; width:200px; border:1px gray solid; padding:5px;" />

<p>I am Liam O'Connor, a computer science researcher, student and teacher, currently working at 
<a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au">UNSW</a>. I specialise
in programming languages and type systems, verification, compilers, formal methods, concurrency and 
parallel programming.</p>

As a member of the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~pls/PLS/PLS.html">UNSW PLS Group</a>, I work
regularly in and on the <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming language and the 
<a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a> proof assistant. I have strong 
interest in the PLS projects <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell">DPH</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate">Accelerate</a> and
<a href="http://disciple.ouroborus.net">Disciple</a>.

<p>I am the designer of the  
<a href="http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/cogent.pml">Cogent</a> language and a contributor to its
associated verification framework and compiler. This project is part of the long-term vision of the
Trustworthy Systems team at Data61, to reduce the cost and effort required to make formally verified systems.
This project forms the basis of my PhD thesis.
In the past I have also worked with the Trustworthy Systems team on the <a href="http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/">l4.verified</a> project and tools for the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/">Isabelle</a>
theorem prover.</a>
