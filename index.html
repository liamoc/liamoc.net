<h2>Welcome</h2>

<img src="/images/me.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 15px; width:200px; border:1px gray solid; padding:5px;" />

<p>I am Liam O'Connor, a computer science researcher, student and teacher, currently working at 
<a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au">UNSW</a>. I specialise
in programming languages and type systems, verification, compilers, formal methods, concurrency and 
parallel programming.</p>

As a member of the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~pls/PLS/PLS.html">UNSW PLS Group</a>, I work
regularly in and on the <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming language and the 
<a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a> proof assistant. I have strong 
interest in the PLS projects <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell">DPH</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate">Accelerate</a> and
<a href="http://disciple.ouroborus.net">Disciple</a>.

<p>Recently, in collaboration with CSIRO Data61 (formerly NICTA), I have been working on designing a 
linear-typed programming language to aid verification of file systems called
<a href="http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/cogent.pml">Cogent</a>.
In the past I have worked on the <a href="http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/">l4.verified</a>
project and tools for the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/">Isabelle</a>
theorem prover.</a>

<p>This contains my <a href="/archive.html">blog</a> as well as a CV and other miscellany.
