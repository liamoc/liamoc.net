I am generally available on the [`#haskell` IRC channel](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel)
 under the username `kamatsu`. I can also be contacted at `me@` this domain.

If you are a student or a colleague, please contact me via my CSE email (username is `liamoc`), or on OpenLearning
or similar course platform.
