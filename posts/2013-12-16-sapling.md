Today was SAPLING 2013, the Sydney Area Programming Languages Interest Group. This year it was hosted
at Macquarie University.

There were many talks of interest to functional programmers, in particular a keynote from Phil Wadler
on a compositional language-integrated query system, talks on flow fusion optimisation and a FFI for
Accelerate respectively from fellow PLSers Amos Robinson and Robert Clifton-Everest, a talk from
Ben Lippmeier on capabilities and coeffects for his new DDC core calculus, and Fritz Henglein's 
[APLAS](/posts/2013-12-13-aplascpp) talk on generic sorting and searching. 

I also presented our trustworthy filesystems work, loosely based on Gabriele Keller's presentation
at PLOS of our [recent paper](/posts/2013-10-07-plospaper).

Further afield, there were also some interesting talks from ANU students on their practical work on
managed runtimes, and some talks from the Victoria University of Wellington on some more conventional
imperative and object oriented language designs.

Many thanks to Phil Wadler for his characteristically soul-destroying questions, and to Tony Sloane for
organising the event, which I think all would agree was a great success.
