[Here](/images/2013-10-18-concurrency.pdf) are the slides I used for my guest lecture today for [Kai's](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~kaie/) wonderful [concurrency appreciation](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3151) course.

In the lecture, I gave a quick surface tour of Haskell's concurrency and parallelism features, with a focus towards STM. More details can be found in Simon Marlow's book, [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929).

I stole much of the STM content directly from Simon Peyton Jones' [Beautiful Concurrency](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/beautiful-concurrency) tutorial.
