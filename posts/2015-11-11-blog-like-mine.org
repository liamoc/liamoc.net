Over the years many people have asked me to share with them how I
developed this website, seeing as it has a variety of very nice features
including:

 - Embedded LaTeX math actually rendered with LaTeX and embedded in the
   document. This means I can use LaTeX packages like ~tikz~ and ~xypic~
   for diagrams, as well as well typeset formulas inline with other text
   with baseline correction. An obligatory demonstration: For inline math,
   $y = mx + b$, and for display math:

   $$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
   
 - Literate Agda support, such as in [[http:/posts/2015-08-23-verified-compiler.html][this article]], with semantic highlighting
   and hyperlinked jump-to-definition, even for the standard library imports.

 - Citeproc based bibliography support, which reads BibTeX databases. Most of 
   my technical articles make use of this, for example [[http:/posts/2015-11-10-patch-theory.html][this article]], and the
   article linked above.

 - Atom-based feed support (see the little button at the bottom of this page)

 - Syntax highlighting for most other languages, such as Haskell, visible 
   in [[http:/posts/2015-11-10-patch-theory.html][the same article linked above]].


Up until recently, I was very reluctant to share the code for this website,
because, among other things:

 - LaTeX rendering was accomplished through the use of an ancient, barely working
   piece of C code I cribbed from the GladTeX installation. It was very system 
   dependent - it required ~latex~, ~dvips~ and ~gs~ to be in exactly the right places
   to work correctly. The formulae were then embedded in the HTML document 
   by _postprocessing_ the output of Pandoc with ~tagsoup~, and detecting any
   equations in a very ad-hoc way. They were cached using a liberal mix of 
   ~unsafePerformIO~ and hacks, which barely worked and typically caused problems
   if the LaTeX failed to compile.

 - The bibliography support relied on a hacky workaround I had written to provide ~Binary~
   instances for an unexposed part of ~pandoc-citeproc~.

 - The site would mysteriously corrupt its own Hakyll cache for no reason.

 - The Literate Agda compiler was hardcoded against an old version of Agda and was pretty 
   unmaintainable.

However I am pleased to announce that now I have cleaned up all of these problems.
The LaTeX rendering has been completely rewritten in Haskell, and is more configurable
   and useful. It's provided in my ~latex-formulae~ suite of packages, available on [[https://github.com/liamoc/latex-formulae][GitHub]] 
   and Hackage under the following three packages:

   - ~latex-formulae-image~ - Basic support for rendering LaTeX formulae to images using
     actual system LaTeX.

   - ~latex-formulae-pandoc~ - Support for rendering LaTeX equations inside pandoc documents,
     and a standalone executable that can be used as a Pandoc filter.

   - ~latex-formulae-hakyll~ - A Hakyll compiler that uses ~latex-formulae-pandoc~, and adds
     some useful caching for Hakyll ~watch~ servers.

 The Agda code has been cleaned up and packaged into two useful Hackage packages, also
   available on [[https://github.com/liamoc/agda-snippets][GitHub]]:

   - ~agda-snippets~ - Support for preprocessing /any text/ document and replacing Agda code 
     blocks with coloured, hyperlinked source in HTML. It leaves the rest of the text untouched,
     so it's possible to then read the output with Pandoc.

   - ~agda-snippets-hakyll~ - Adds some basic mechanisms to integrate ~agda-snippets~ with Hakyll
     and Pandoc.

 The bibliography workaround is no longer necessary, due to fixes in upstream libraries.

The other features (feeds, highlighting) are all just provided by Hakyll built-in. The source of
this website itself is also available on [[https://github.com/liamoc/liamoc.net][GitHub]], in particular the [[https://github.com/liamoc/liamoc.net/blob/master/site.hs][Hakyll code]] for it may be of interest.
