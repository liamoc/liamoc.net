#+TITLE: Music

[[./images/music.png]]

In addition to my computer science career I am also a classically-trained singer, with extensive experience in liturgical music in the Catholic and Anglican traditions. 

Currently, I sing with the [[https://www.allsaintsainslie.org.au/][Choir of All Saints, Ainslie]], located near my home in Canberra. We sing for most of the weekly Sunday Eucharist services as well as semi-regular Evensong services. I am also available for liturgical singing in and around the Canberra area. Please get in touch if you are interested.

I began my musical career as a treble in [[https://cathedralchoir.sydney/][St. Mary's Cathedral Choir, Sydney]] at the age of 10. At that time, St. Mary's was under the direction of David Russell, who encouraged me to pursue my interest in medieval liturgical music. I studied Gregorian Chant semiology and performance, both independently and under the tutelage of Prof. Neil McEwan FRSCM. 

From 2006-2010 I led the Schola Cantorum at St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, performing the propers of the mass every Sunday.  I also performed occasionally with many other choirs, including: the [[https://ccsl.org.au/][Choir of Christ Church St. Laurence]] in Sydney, the [[https://www.brandenburg.com.au/][Australian Brandenburg Choir]], and others. After Pope Benedict XVI's /Summorum pontificum/, I ran a Schola Cantorum to assist in the performance of chant propers and ordinaries in Latin masses around Sydney and later in Edinburgh, after I moved there.

In 2022 I visited the monks at the [[https://www.solesmes.com/][Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Solesmes]], under Dom Geoffrey Kemlin. In Edinburgh I sang with the the Choir of [[https://www.stmichaelandallsaints.org/][St. Michael and All Saints Episcopal Church]]. I am a member of the [[https://rscmaustralia.org.au/][Royal School of Church Music]].

In particular, I have an interest and considerable expertise in the rich chant tradition of the medieval western church, and I am seeking rare prayer books, hymnals, graduals, nocturnals, vesperals, diurnals, antiphonaries and similar. In particular, I am looking for (reprintings of):
- A Cistercian Gradual,
- A Medicaea Gradual,
- Amiens and/or Paris Graduals
- Facsimiles of manuscripts.
I am also generally interested in liturgical music that is solemn and ancient. If you have any books that may be interesting to me, please get in touch. I already have a complete set of books for the Sarum Use (both Mass and Office) and all of the recent Solesmes books, including Les Heures Gr√©goriennes, the Liber Usualis, the Graduale Triplex (and Simplex), the Antiphonale Romanum (and Monasticum) and the Graduale Novum. With regards to the Anglican tradition, I have a Noted Book of Common Prayer, the New English Hymnal, and various Oxford Anthem books.
