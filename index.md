<h2>Welcome</h2>


I am Liam O'Connor, a a Lecturer
in Programming Languages for Trustworthy Systems for <a href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs">LFCS</a> at the <a href="http://inf.ed.ac.uk">University of Edinburgh School of Informatics</a>. I specialise
in programming languages and type systems, verification, formal methods, and concurrency.

In my previous posting at the University of New South Wales I taught several courses ranging from 
theory of programming languages to concurrency to formal methods. At Edinburgh, I am focusing primarily 
on research work for the moment, although I am involved in supervisory duties for Informatics 1A on Functional Programming.

I work
regularly in and on the <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming language and the 
<a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a> proof assistant. Much of my
research work involves these languages. I am the Social Media Editor of the <a href="https://twitter.com/cup_jfp">Journal of Functional Programming</a>.

Originally part of my doctorate and now as ongoing research work, I designed the <a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au/projects/TS/cogent.pml">Cogent</a> programming language,
and I remain a 
contributor to its
associated verification framework and compiler. This project is part of the long-term vision of the
<a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au">Trustworthy Systems</a> team at <a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au">CSIRO Data61</a>, to reduce the cost and effort required to make formally verified systems.
In the past I have also worked with the Trustworthy Systems team on the <a href="http://ts.data61.csiro.au.au/projects/l4.verified/">l4.verified</a> project and tools for the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/">Isabelle</a>
theorem prover.</a> I have also been affiliated with 
the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell">DPH</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate">Accelerate</a> projects as my PhD supervisor
was <a href="https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/GKKeller">Prof. Gabriele Keller</a>. 

This contains my <a href="/posts/archive.html">blog</a> as well as a publication list, and other miscellany.
