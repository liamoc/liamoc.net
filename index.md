<h2>Welcome</h2>

<img src="/images/me.jpeg" class='portrait' />

I am Liam O'Connor, a Senior Lecturer[^1] at the <a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University School of Computing</a>. I specialise
in programming languages and type systems, verification, formal methods, and concurrency. I am also an Honorary Fellow in Programming Languages for Trustworthy Systems at the <a href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs">Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://inf.ed.ac.uk">University of Edinburgh School of Informatics</a>.

I do not yet have any teaching commitments at ANU. At Edinburgh, I tought courses on theoretical computer science, discrete mathematics, and concurrency theory.

I work
regularly in and on the <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming language and the
<a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a> proof assistant. Much of my
research work involves these languages. I am the Social Media Editor of the <a href="https://twitter.com/cup_jfp">Journal of Functional Programming</a>, and a Member-at-Large of the Steering Committee of <a href="http://tydeworkshop.org/">TyDe</a>. <!-- I am also the Publicity Chair of the <a href="http://scottish-pl-institute.github.io/">Scottish Programming Languages Institute</a>.-->

I am the designer of the <a href="http://liamoc.net/holbert">Holbert</a> educational proof assistant.

I am also the lead researcher for the <a href="https://quickstrom.io">Quickstrom</a> testing tool. This project is joint work with <a href="https://wickstrom.tech/">Oskar Wickstr√∂m</a> and my PhD student Rayhana Amjad (with <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/">Rob van Glabbeek</a> as secondary supervisor).

I am also co-supervising a PhD student, Tudor Ferariu, on verification of blockchain smart contracts with <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/">Phil Wadler</a>. I am also second supervisor to Mathieu Fehr, whose primary supervisor is <a href="https://grosser.science/">Tobias Grosser</a>.

Originally part of my doctorate and now as ongoing research work, I designed the <a href="https://trustworthy.systems/projects/TS/cogent.pml">Cogent</a> programming language,
and I remain a
contributor to its
associated verification framework and compiler. This project is part of the long-term vision of the
<a href="https://trustworthy.systems">Trustworthy Systems</a> team (formerly at CSIRO Data61), to reduce the cost and effort required to make formally verified systems.
In the past I have also worked with the Trustworthy Systems team on the <a href="https://trustworthy.systems/projects/seL4-verification/">l4.verified</a> project and tools for the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/">Isabelle</a>
theorem prover.</a> I have also been affiliated with
the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell">DPH</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate">Accelerate</a> projects as my PhD supervisor
was <a href="https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/GKKeller">Gabriele Keller</a>.

In my free time, I like to collect and tinker on <a href="/computers.html">old and obsolete computers</a>. Please get in touch with me if you want to collaborate on retro computing projects, donate a computer, or visit to see my collection of old computers.

This contains my <a href="/posts/archive.html">blog</a> as well as a publication list, and other miscellany.

[^1]: This is equivalent to a Reader in the UK and possibly an Associate Professor in the US, but lower than the Associate Professor rank here in Australia.
