    abstract = {{The linear logic of J.-Y. Girard suggests a new type system for functional
languages, one which supports operations that \&quot;change the world\&quot;. Values belonging
to a linear type must be used exactly once: like the world, they cannot be
duplicated or destroyed. Such values require no reference counting or garbage collection,
and safely admit destructive array update. Linear types extend Schmidt's
notion of single threading; provide an alternative to Hudak and Bloss' update
analysis; and offer a...}},
