Leo, 1988-2004. Rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings.
Jason, 1970-2005. One day pours out its song to another, and one night whispers secrets to another.
Jon, 1958-2020. Felt so lonely and old, but the sun kept a'shinin' and the banjo kept a'playin'.
Annie, 1998-2020. May you play again, in some other way, and may you be happy.
Alex, 1983-2019. Discounting it. Looking at the sky. Chatting idly.
Martin, 1965-2018. I know not for whom; I no longer know what it is about.

Patricia, John, Mark. My family.
